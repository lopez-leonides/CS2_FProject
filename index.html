          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to My Website! My
            name is <strong>Leonides Lopez</strong>, and I am a student studying
            in Computer Technology and a <em>Self-Taught Visual Artist</em> . As
            a student, I have been studying Computer Technology for 2 years.
            During this time, I have gained experience in various programming
            languages and tools, such as <em>C++, C#, and HTML5</em>. I am
            particularly interested in <em>C# and C++ Programming Language</em>,
            and I am always eager to learn more about this field. In addition to
            my studies in Computer Technology, I am also a
            <em> Self-Taught Visual Artist</em>. I have been practicing art for
            5 years, and I enjoy working with Oil Paintings. My passion for art
            has led me to support my needs for my studies today. I joined
            exhibitions and sell my work to collectors around Cebu. One of my
            favorite piece that I made was the Portrait of Saint John Bosco,
            where I was able to meticulously expressed my skills as a Visual
            Artist. This experience taught me valuable lessons about being
            patient and perseverance. As a student and artist, I value learning
            various of things, and I believe that these values have helped me to
            succeed in both areas. In terms of my education, I am currently
            pursuing my degree in Computer Technology from
            <em>Lapu-Lapu City College</em>. I am also continuing to learn and
            grow as an artist by making Portrait Paintings and Religious
            Paintings, and I am always looking for new opportunities to improve
            my skills and knowledge in both fields.
